## Summary:

I have designed a landing page for the 8th Lone Star College Campus (Lone Star Airship) using HTML, CSS and Javscript. Throughout this process, I made sure to adhere to the deliverables requested, as well as basic design procedures. 

## Design Process:

The start of my deisgn process always begins with discovery. This included compiling full web page layouts of other education landing pages, browsing design sites for inspiration, and collecting brand standards and market materials from the LSC Systems website. I then created a mock project management board using Github Projects to keep track of deliverables and components. I created mockups and wireframes by hand, sketching the process in a notebook.  

## Development Process:

I began developing by tackling key components I deemed neccesary such as a header, footer, and main body layout. After incorporating styles and fonts, I began to layout each section until I was satisified with the general layout. From there, I added smaller components such as the countdown timer and images to each section. Throughout this process, I used https://validator.w3.org/ for validation and best practices, as well as CSS media queries for mobile responsiveness. 

## Future Development :

Given more time, I would have developed further for mobile devices, including a custom header button for navigation that could be toggled for ease of use. Items such as a splashscreen for mobile loading may be helpful as well.  I would also further validate for accesibility, using footer links to transform the page for ESL readers. Further functionality for the programs buttons to render content would also be ideal, including branding of key partners (Microsoft & Cisco).
